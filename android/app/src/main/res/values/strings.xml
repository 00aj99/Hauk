    <string name="explain_adopt_title">Share adoption</string>
    <string name="explain_adopt_body">Hauk allows you to create location sharing sessions for yourself as well as for a group of people. If someone creates a group share, they get a group code that others can use to join the sharing session.\n\nHowever, the person creating the group share also gets the option to add an already existing location share into their group. This process is called adoption.\n\nYou can decide whether or not you want to allow others to incorporate your location share into their group share by checking this checkbox.\n\nIf you enable this option and share your location to a group of friends, and someone else also wants to share their location, they can create a group share and add you to their map, so both of you appear on the same shared location map. This is useful if you are e.g. driving and cannot use your phone, as adoption of your share by others requires no interaction on your part.</string>

    <string name="create_link_body">You can create several links to access your shared location.
